	<p> Experimental physicist / engineer with over 10 years of experience in applied computing and data acquisition, organization, and visualization for precision optics experiments. Facilitated the research and development of advanced mirror coatings and optical systems, leveraging engineering skills with the Pound-Derver-Hall technique, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback, analog/digital filter design, image analysis, and programming to enhance research outcomes and operational efficiency to achieve collaboration objectives. Comitted to learning, applying, and pioneering new methodologies in technology, computing, and data analysis to help improve outcomes of pre-exisiting systems. </p>
